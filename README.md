# The Cow Pasture: Various boards and add-ons for the Macintosh LC and variants

## [Cow-Flipper](cow-flipper)

An adapter to flip the LC internal SCSI port by 180-degrees so devices like the original BlueSCSI can be plugged in with the OEM cable.

## [Stealth Cow](stealth-cow)

Adapter for dual-disk-drive LCs, so they can have an internal BlueSCSI drive while keeping both floppy drives. A work-in-progess.
